# KafkaQuickStart

# Goal
Initially a personal project in order to get familiar with Apache tooling and concepts, but pull requests are more than welcome, as long as they aid to the learning experience.

# Steps
The kafka_bin.sh and kafka_config.sh files have been developed in order to group together generally used functions and can hence be used to prepare new environments for the use of kafka.
